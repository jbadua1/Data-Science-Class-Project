# Data-Science-Class-Project
STAT613 Data Science Project for Fall 2019
### Introduction

For this project, we want to address what variables have an affect on the quality of red and white wine. If you wanted to start a wine business, you probably need to think first of which wine you'd be making, white or red? Then you'd have to think within each wine what type are you going for? Sweeter? Drier? What kind of aromas are you going for?

**We want to know what physicochemical factors have an influence on the quality of red and white wine**
